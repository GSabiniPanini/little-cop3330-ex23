/**
 Exercise 23 - Troubleshooting Car Issues
 An expert system is a type of artificial intelligence program that uses a knowledge base and a set of rules to perform a task that a human expert might do.
 Many websites are available that will help you self-diagnose a medical issue by answering a series of questions.
 And many hardware and software companies offer online troubleshooting tools to help people solve simple technical issues before calling a human.

 Create a program that walks the user through troubleshooting issues with a car. Use the following decision tree to build the system:

 Example Output
 Is the car silent when you turn the key? y
 Are the battery terminals corroded? n
 The battery cables may be damaged.
 Replace cables and try again.

 Constraint
 Ask only questions that are relevant to the situation and to the previous answers.
 Donâ€™t ask for all inputs at once.

 Challenge
 Investigate rules engines and inference engines.
 These are powerful ways to solve complex problems that are based on rules and facts.
 Identify a rules engine for your programming language and use it to solve this problem
